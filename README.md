Frankly
The Frankly project empowers users to uncover business jargon that has become ubiquitous in corporate communications. We have all heard these common phrases that from a “30,000 foot view” are “real head-scratchers.” This project helps to uncover business buzzwords hiding in your everyday corporate texts.
With Frankly, simply enter text in the text box. Frankly accepts mission statements, your colleague’s emails, or any other text you want to scan. Frankly provides a buzzword count, an analysis of the complexity and overall sentiment. We take the big data approach by comparing the text you provide to a list of our commonly used buzzwords, just to make sure we circle back and provide you with firm answers.You can even cover your bases by adding your favorite buzzwords.
Enjoy, play around, and poke fun at your co-workers!
